## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd G:\Arc-Microcredit-Protocol\backend\services
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Add to `backend/.env`:
```env
DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID="your-environment-id"
DYNAMIC_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
REPUTATION_CREDIT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73"
```

### 3. Create Server Wallets
```bash
npm run setup
```
This creates admin and lender wallets, displays their IDs and addresses.

### 4. Authorize Wallets in Contract
Add the lender wallet address as an authorized lender:
```solidity
reputationCredit.addAuthorizedLender(lenderWalletAddress)
```

### 5. Run Automated Services

**Create Credit Profile:**
```bash
npm run create-profile 0xUserAddress 750
```

**Start Loan Approval Monitor:**
```bash
npm run approve-loans
```
