# Quick Start: Using Regular Wallet (No Server Wallets Needed!)

## âœ… Setup Steps

### Step 1: Get Your Wallet Address

You'll need:
- Your wallet address (like `0x1234...`)
- Your private key (for authorizing, or use MetaMask to sign transactions)

### Step 2: Authorize Your Wallet in the Contract

Your wallet needs to be authorized as a lender. You can do this:

**Option A: Using MetaMask/Your Wallet** (Easiest)
1. Open your wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
2. Connect to Arc Testnet (Chain ID: 5042002)
3. Go to: https://testnet.arcscan.app (the explorer)
4. Use the "Write Contract" feature to call `addAuthorizedLender(yourAddress)`
   - Contract: `0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73`
   - Function: `addAuthorizedLender`
   - Parameter: Your wallet address

**Option B: Using Foundry Cast** (If you have it)
```bash
cd G:\Arc-Microcredit-Protocol\backend
cast send 0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73 \
  "addAuthorizedLender(address)" YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.arc.network \
  --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Step 3: Create Credit Profiles

When users need profiles, you can create them manually:

**Using MetaMask/Your Wallet:**
1. Go to ArcScan explorer
2. Use "Write Contract" â†’ `createCreditProfile(userAddress, initialScore)`
   - Example: `createCreditProfile(0xUserAddress, 750)`

**Using Cast:**
```bash
cast send 0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73 \
  "createCreditProfile(address,uint256)" USER_ADDRESS 750 \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.arc.network \
  --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Step 4: Approve Loans

When loans are requested, approve them:

**Using MetaMask/Your Wallet:**
1. Go to ArcScan explorer
2. Use "Write Contract" â†’ `approveLoan(borrowerAddress, loanId)`
   - Example: `approveLoan(0xBorrowerAddress, 0)`

**Using Cast:**
```bash
cast send 0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73 \
  "approveLoan(address,uint256)" BORROWER_ADDRESS 0 \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.arc.network \
  --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

## ðŸ“‹ Workflow

1. **User connects wallet** â†’ Frontend shows they need a profile
2. **You create profile** â†’ Call `createCreditProfile(userAddress, 750)`
3. **User requests loan** â†’ Shows as pending in frontend
4. **You approve loan** â†’ Call `approveLoan(userAddress, loanId)`
5. **User repays** â†’ Automatic via frontend!

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

- âœ… No server wallet setup needed
- âœ… Works immediately
- âœ… Full control
- âœ… Perfect for testing and small-scale use

## ðŸ”§ Automation Later (Optional)

When you're ready, you can:
1. Set up WSL
2. Run the Node SDK scripts
3. Automate approvals

But for now, manual is perfectly fine!

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **Keep your wallet funded** with USDC for gas fees
- **Check loan requests** periodically in the frontend
- **Use ArcScan explorer** for easy contract interactions
- **Bookmark** the contract address: `0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73`

**You're all set!** Your protocol works perfectly with just your regular wallet! ðŸš€
