# Why Contract Isn't Verified - Explanation

## What Happened

The contract verification is **NOT related to Dynamic** at all. They're completely separate:

- **Contract Verification** = Shows source code on ArcScan explorer
- **Dynamic** = Wallet management service (for server wallets)

## Why Verification Might Have Failed

Looking at your deployment script, verification requires:
1. `ARCSCAN_API_KEY` in `.env` file
2. ArcScan API accepting the verification request

Common reasons verification fails:
- ❌ No `ARCSCAN_API_KEY` in `.env` when deployed
- ❌ API key was invalid/expired
- ❌ ArcScan API was down during deployment
- ❌ Verification was skipped (`--verify` flag might not have worked)

## This is NOT a Problem!

**Your contract works perfectly without verification!**

- ✅ Frontend works (uses ABI directly)
- ✅ Functions work (verification doesn't affect on-chain code)
- ✅ You can interact via MetaMask + contract ABI
- ✅ Everything functions normally

Verification is just for **convenience** - easier to read code on explorer.

## How to Verify Now (Optional)

If you want to verify it:

### Method 1: Using Foundry

```bash
# Make sure you have ARCSCAN_API_KEY in .env
forge verify-contract \
  0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73 \
  src/ReputationCredit.sol:ReputationCredit \
  --chain-id 5042002 \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.arc.network \
  --verifier-url https://testnet.arcscan.app/api \
  --verifier etherscan \
  --etherscan-api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Method 2: Manual via ArcScan UI

1. Go to: https://testnet.arcscan.app/address/0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73
2. Click "Verify Contract" or "Verify and Publish"
3. Enter:
   - Compiler Version: `0.8.20`
   - License: `MIT`
   - Optimization: `Yes` (200 runs)
   - Paste contract source from `src/ReputationCredit.sol`
4. Submit

## Bottom Line

**Dynamic integration has ZERO impact on contract verification.**

They're unrelated systems:
- Contract = Smart contract code (Solidity)
- Dynamic = Wallet service (TypeScript/Node.js)

You can use Dynamic server wallets with verified OR unverified contracts - makes no difference!

**Recommendation:** Use your contract as-is. Verify later if you want people to read the code easily on ArcScan. It's purely cosmetic!
