## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

Your contract is now verified on ArcScan:

- **View on:** https://testnet.arcscan.app/address/0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73

## ðŸš€ Next Step: Authorize Your Wallet

Now you can easily authorize your wallet using ArcScan's UI:

### Option 1: Using ArcScan UI (Easiest!)

1. **Go to:** https://testnet.arcscan.app/address/0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73#writeContract
2. **Connect your wallet** (MetaMask) - make sure you're on Arc Testnet
3. **Scroll to:** `addAuthorizedLender` function
4. **Enter your wallet address:** `0xB1A4e075EA6B04357D6907864FCDF65B73Ea3b6E`
5. **Click:** "Write" button
6. **Confirm** in MetaMask

Done! âœ… Your wallet is now authorized as a lender.

### Option 2: Using Cast (If Foundry is installed)

```bash
cast send 0xa8d7b887B046fbd51a4d2E870c99F1b86CC6de73 \
  "addAuthorizedLender(address)" 0xB1A4e075EA6B04357D6907864FCDF65B73Ea3b6E \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.arc.network \
  --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

## ðŸ“‹ After Authorization

Your wallet can now:
- âœ… Create credit profiles (`createCreditProfile`)
- âœ… Approve loans (`approveLoan`)
- âœ… Manage the protocol

## ðŸŽ¯ Test the Frontend

```bash
cd G:\Arc-Microcredit-Protocol\frontend
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Connect your wallet
3. Test creating profiles and approving loans!
